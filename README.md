 ## House Price Prediction using Machine Learning 🏡💰
# Predict house prices using Linear Regression based on key property features.

## Project Overview 🚀


This project predicts house prices using Machine Learning (Linear Regression) based on various features like area, number of rooms, overall quality, and garage size.

The dataset comes from the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle.


## Dataset 📂


The dataset used is from Kaggle.

It contains 81 features describing house characteristics, such as:

OverallQual (Overall material quality)

GrLivArea (Above ground living area)

GarageCars (Number of cars that fit in the garage)

TotalBsmtSF (Total basement area)

SalePrice (Target variable - House selling price)

## Technologies Used 📌


✅ Python 🐍

✅ Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)

✅ Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

✅ Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)

## Project Workflow ⚙️ 


1️⃣ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Finding feature correlations and visualizing data.

3️⃣ Feature Engineering: Selecting the most important features.

4️⃣ Model Training: Training a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices.

5️⃣ Evaluation: Measuring model performance using MAE, MSE, and R² Score.
